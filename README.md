# Decentralized_Ledger_System

![application-image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119983156/233724063-8dcc5b3a-8a24-4af3-941d-6a1cc9ba3e5a.png)

Blockchain Based Ledger system


## Background

You’re a fintech engineer who’s working at one of the five largest banks in the world. You were recently promoted to act as the lead developer on their decentralized finance team. Your task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## Features and Implementation - Vision and Results:

Open the pychain.py file that your Challenge files include. You’ll use this file to complete the steps for this Challenge. Notice that the PyChain ledger that you built throughout this module already includes the functionality to create blocks, perform the proof of work consensus protocol, and validate blocks in the chain.

The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

    1. Create a Record Data Class

    2. Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data

    3. Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface

    4. Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records

## Technologies

This project utilizes several modules that provide various functionalities for building a web application.

### Required Modules

The following modules were used in this project:

- **Streamlit**: A popular Python web application framework that allows developers to create and deploy interactive web applications with ease. Streamlit provides various tools for building interactive data visualizations, creating forms, and deploying machine learning models.

    - PyPI package: https://pypi.org/project/streamlit/
    
- **dataclasses**: A module that provides a decorator and functions for creating classes that can be used to store data in a structured format. This module simplifies the process of creating structured data classes in Python.

    - Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html
    
- **typing**: A module that provides various types and classes for type hinting in Python. Type hinting is used to specify the expected type of a variable or function parameter, which can improve code readability and maintainability.

    - Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html
    
- **datetime**: A module that provides various classes for working with dates and times in Python. This module provides functionalities such as creating, manipulating, and formatting dates and times.

    - Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
    
- **pandas**: A module that provides tools for data manipulation and analysis. This module is widely used in the finance industry to organize financial data and perform advanced decision-making.

    - GitHub repository: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas
    
- **hashlib**: A module that provides various cryptographic hash functions for secure password storage and data encryption. This module is used to securely store user passwords in the web application.

    - Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html


    
## Usage

This application can be accessed by accessing google colab, by connecting the repository file on your local computer to your google Drive account, you can access the Google Colab notebook.

# Evaluation Report


### Instructions :

#### 1. Install Streamlit
'''pip install streamlit'''

#### 2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the pychain_demo.py file is saved.

#### 3. Run the app
'''streamlit run pychain_demo.py'''

#### 4. Access the app

 Once the app is running, you should see a message similar to "You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser at: http://localhost:8501/". Open your web browser and navigate to that URL to access the app.

#### 5. Interact with the app

Once you have accessed the app, you can interact with it using the widgets on the left-hand side. For example, you can add a new block to the blockchain by entering data into the text box and clicking the "Add Block" button. You can also view the current state of the blockchain by clicking the "View Blockchain" button.

#### 6. Try out different features
 Play around with the different features of the app to get a feel for how it works. You can also modify the code in pychain_demo.py to customize the app to your liking.

### Baseline Performance :

The Blockchain pychain_demo.py application displays the basic functionalities of a blockchain-- with the decentralized ledger system and other typical functions of the blockchain. Though there are no further security features added on to the program, these will be added onto the 'pychain_secure.py' application, which I plan on working on further in the future.
